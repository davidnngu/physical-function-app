Need Xcode 10.2 and Cocoapods installed.
After downloading file, go on terminal and navigate to folder. 
Once in the folder, type "pod deintegrate" to uninstall the pods.
Upon completion, type "pod install" to reinstall the pods.
After this is done, the project may be accessed through opening the PhysicalFunction.xcworkspace file.

Any questions? Please contact comp523-physicalfunction@office.unc.edu
Thank you!
